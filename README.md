# Introduction

Thanks for the challenge Team. I really enjoyed working on it and learned some new things as well.

## Setup

1. I've pushed my work on main branch itself.
2. I've assumed the modified value from sample data is in milliseconds to I've converted it into date format
3. I've applied debounced functionality in selection change to let user finish selection first.
4. I've applied some styles but they can be improvised a lot more for sure.
5. I've grouped the list by type so I am not showing type inside every section as mentioned in the representational details.
6. I've tried to segregate css for possible components and created base.css for global colors and margins. this can be improved ofcourse to make this more generic.

## API.js

```
.-----------------------------------------------.
| <id> - by: <author>                    <type> |
| Updated: <modified date>                      |
`-----------------------------------------------`

This challenge is meant to be somewhat open-ended. Feel free to make assumptions and
unblock yourself. Just make sure to make a note of all the assumptions as code comments.
